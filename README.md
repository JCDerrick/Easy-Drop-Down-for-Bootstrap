This is a free light weight jQuery plugin based on the 'ddslick' plugin originally created by Prashant Chaudhary that allows developers to create a custom drop down with images and description.

Features available in this plugin:

-Optional Ability to include images and descriptions to otherwise boring drop downs.
-Allows the use of JSON to populate the drop down options.
-Converts HTML select element to a combination of easily stylable elements
-Uses Minimum CSS by default (external CSS override possible and sample CSS code is included)
-Supports callback functions on option selection.
-Integrated with Font-Awesome


Why is this plugin is useful:

With traditional drop downs (i.e.; using <select> <option> </option> </select>) you are always limited to only text and a corresponding value parameter. But with this easily configurable jQuery plugin, you can now easily create a custom drop down that can very well include images, a short description, or the standard text and value parameters.

Demo's will be coming soon...
